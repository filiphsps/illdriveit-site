## CODE STYLE:
### TYPESCRIPT/JAVASCRIPT:
  - Use soft-tabs with a FOUR space indent.
  - TODO

### SCSS/CSS
  - Use soft-tabs with a FOUR space indent.
  - Put spaces before { in rule declarations.
  - Put line breaks between rulesets.
  - When grouping selectors, keep individual selectors to a single line.
  - Place closing braces of declaration blocks on a new line.
  - Each declaration should appear on its own line for more accurate error reporting.
  - Use hex color codes #000 unless using rgba().
  - Use // for comment blocks (instead of /* */).
  - Avoid specifying units for zero values, e.g., margin: 0; instead of margin: 0px;.
  - Strive to limit use of shorthand declarations to instances where you must explicitly set all the available values.
