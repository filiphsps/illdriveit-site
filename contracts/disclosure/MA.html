        </h2>

        <p>
            NOTICE TO CUSTOMER: PURCHASE OF THIS CONTRACT IS NOT REQUIRED IN ORDER TO
            REGISTER OR FINANCE YOUR VEHICLE. THE BENEFITS PROVIDED MAY DUPLICATE
            EXPRESS MANUFACTURER’S OR SELLER’S WARRANTIES THAT COME AUTOMATICALLY
            WITH EVERY SALE. THE SELLER OF THIS COVERAGE IS REQUIRED TO INFORM YOU OF
            ANY WARRANTIES AVAILABLE TO YOU WITHOUT THIS CONTRACT.<br/><br/>
            Chapter 90, Section 7N.25 of Massachusetts General Laws requires an automobile dealer to provide a
            warranty covering certain classes of used motor vehicles as follows: Used vehicles less than40,000 miles at
            the time of sale: provides coverage for 90 days or 3750 miles, whichever comes first. Used vehicles with
            greater than 40,000 miles but less than 80,000 miles at the time of sale: provides coverage for 60 days or
            2500 miles, whichever comes first. Used vehicles with greater than 80,000 miles but less than 125,000 miles
            at time of sale: provides coverage for 30 days or 1250 miles, whichever occurs first. The VEHICLE you
            have purchased may be covered by this law. If so, the following is added to this CONTRACT: In addition to
            the dealer warranty required by this law, you have elected to purchase this CONTRACT, which may provide
            you with additional protection during the dealer warranty period and provides protection after the dealer
            warranty has expired. You have been charged separately only for this CONTRACT. The required dealer
            warranty is provided free of charge. Furthermore, the definitions, coverages and exclusions stated in this
            CONTRACT apply only to this CONTRACT and not the terms of the required dealer warranty.
