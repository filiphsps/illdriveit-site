        <h1>SPECIAL LOUISIANA REQUIREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES</h1>
        <h2>
            The following State Specific Requirements apply if your CONTRACT was purchased in LOUISIANA and
            supersede any other provision herein of the contrary
        </h2>

        <p>
            The CANCELLATION PROCEDURES section is amended as follows: In the event a request from the
            PURCHASER/LENDER/PROVIDER is made within sixty (60) days of purchase, a flat cancellation will be
            allowed. If the PURCHASER/LENDER/PROVIDER requests a cancellation after sixty (60) days, the
            ADMINISTRATOR agrees to calculate and make available a pro-rata refund percentage figure based on the
            time or mileage, whichever refund is less. All other language reflected in this section remains unchanged.
