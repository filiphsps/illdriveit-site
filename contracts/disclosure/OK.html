        <h1>SPECIAL OKLAHOMA REQUIREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES</h1>
        <h2>
            The following State Specific Requirements apply if your CONTRACT was purchased in OKLAHOMA and
            supersede any other provision herein of the contrary
        </h2>

        <p>
            All refunds payable to you under this CONTRACT in the event you cancel this CONTRACT shall be payable
            to you and any lien holder as your respective interests may appear.
            The section entitled "CANCELLATION PROCEDURES" is replaced in its entirety with the following: If your
            vehicle has been repossessed, declared a total loss or you give notice of cancellation, this CONTRACT will
            terminate. You may cancel this CONTRACT at any time by notifying the Selling Dealer or
            ADMINISTRATOR in writing of intent to cancel. You must also send the Selling Dealer or
            ADMINISTRATOR this CONTRACT and a notarized statement indicating the actual mileage (odometer
            reading) of your vehicle at the date of the request. If the PURCHASER cancels this agreement within the
            first sixty (60) days of the effective date, and no claims have been paid, they will receive a full refund. If
            the PURCHASER cancels the CONTRACT after sixty (60) days, or has made a claim within the first sixty (60)
            days, the PROVIDER shall retain ten percent (10%) of the unearned pro rata contract purchase price or fifty
            dollars ($50.00), whichever is less. If the contract is canceled by the PROVIDER, return of premium shall be
            based upon one hundred percent (100%) of unearned pro rata premium. All refunds payable to you under
            this CONTRACT in the event you cancel this CONTRACT shall be payable to you and any lien holder as
            your respective interests may appear. If there is no lien holder, the refund will be paid to you. If there is a
            lien holder the refund will be paid to the lien holder. Note: Transferred CONTRACTS are not eligible for
            cancellation refunds.
            The ARBITRATION PROVISION section of this CONTRACT is amended to include the following:
            While arbitration is mandatory, the outcome of any arbitration shall be non-binding on the parties, and
            either party shall, following arbitration, have the right to reject the arbitration award and bring suit in a
            district court of Oklahoma.
            Coverage afforded under this CONTRACT is not guaranteed by the Oklahoma Insurance Guaranty
            Association. Oklahoma service warranty statutes do not apply to commercial use references in service
            warranty contracts.
