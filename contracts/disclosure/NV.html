        <h1>SPECIAL NEVADA REQUIREMENTS AND DISCLOSURE</h1>
        <h2>
            The following State Specific Requirements apply if your CONTRACT was purchased in NEVADA and
            supersede any other provision herein of the contrary:
        </h2>

        <p>
            <h3>Under “EXCLUSIONS FROM COVERAGE” AND/OR “OTHER EXCLUSIONS FROM COVERAGE”:</h3>
            #10 is amended as follows: “This CONTRACT will not be initially issued to any VEHICLE with
            modifications or alterations to VEHICLE not approved by the manufacturer. However, if such
            modifications or alterations are made to the VEHICLE during the term of the CONTRACT, WE will
            not automatically suspend or exclude all coverage. This CONTRACT will exclude all coverage
            pertaining to the modified or altered components of the VEHICLE, but this CONTRACT will
            continue to provide any applicable coverage pertaining to any other components of the VEHICLE
            that remain within manufacturer specifications or are otherwise eligible for coverage under this
            CONTRACT, unless such coverage is otherwise excluded under this CONTRACT.”
            #17 is amended to include “Claims paid will never be deducted from any refund issued under this
            contract.” If you purchased a MBPI VALUE PLUS PRE-OWNED VEHICLE SERVICE
            CONTRACT (ASVPO911), it is amended to include “Claims paid will never be deducted from any
            refund issued under this contract”

            <h3>The CANCELLATION PROCEDURES section is amended to include the following:</h3>
            Claims paid will never be deducted from any refund issued under this contract. In the event a request
            from the PURCHASER/LENDER/PROVIDER is made within sixty (60) days of purchase (or, if the
            CONTRACT was mailed, within 20 days after the mailing date) and no claims have been filed, a flat
            cancellation and a full refund will be allowed.
            After this CONTRACT has been in effect for seventy (70) days, We may not cancel this
            CONTRACT except for one of the following reasons: (A) if You fail to pay an amount when due;
            (B) if You are convicted of a crime which results in an increase in the service required under this
            CONTRACT; (C) discovery of fraud or material misrepresentation by You in obtaining this
            CONTRACT or in presenting a Claim for service; (D) discovery of an act or omission by You or if
            You violate any condition of this CONTRACT after the effective date of this CONTRACT which
            substantially and materially increases the service required under this CONTRACT; or (E) a material
            change in the nature or extent of the required service or repair which occurs after the effective date of
            this CONTRACT which causes the required service or repair to be substantially and materially
            increased beyond that contemplated at the time the CONTRACT was issued or sold. If We cancel
            this CONTRACT based on one or more of the above reasons, We will mail written notice of
            cancellation to You at least fifteen (15) days prior to the effective date of cancellation. We will
            refund the unearned CONTRACT purchase price to You calculated on a pro rata basis. The refund
            will be equal to the lesser amount produced using either the number of days the CONTRACT was in
            force or the number of miles the vehicle was driven prior to cancellation. This agreement is nonrenewable.
            
            <br/><br/>
            A ten percent (10%) penalty per month shall be added to a refund that is not made within forty-five
            (45) days of return of this CONTRACT to Us.
