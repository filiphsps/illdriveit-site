        <h1>SPECIAL HAWAII REQUIREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES</h1>
        <h2>
            The following State Specific Requirements apply if your CONTRACT was purchased in HAWAII and
            supersede any other provision herein of the contrary
        </h2>

        <p>
            Hawaii Revised Statutes requires an automobile dealer to provide a warranty covering certain classes of used
            motor vehicle as follows: Used vehicles with less than 25,000 miles at the time of sale - provides coverage for
            90 days or 5000 miles, whichever comes first. Used vehicles greater than 25,000 miles but less than 50,000
            miles at the time of sale – provides coverage for 60 days or 3000 miles, whichever occurs first. Used vehicles
            greater than 50,000 miles but less than 75,000 miles at the time of sale – provides coverage for 30 days or 1000
            miles, whichever occurs first. The VEHICLE you have purchased may be covered by this law. If so, the
            following is added to this CONTRACT: In addition to the dealer warranty required by this law, you have
            elected to purchase this CONTRACT, which may provide you with additional protection during the dealer
            warranty period and provides protection after the dealer warranty has expired. You have been charged
            separately only for this CONTRACT. The required dealer warranty is provided free of charge. Furthermore,
            the definitions, coverages and exclusions stated in this CONTRACT apply only to this CONTRACT and are
            not the terms of the required dealer warranty. Notice of cancellation will state one of the above mentioned
            basis of cancellation and will include any reimbursement required. The cancellation will be effective as of the
            date of termination as stated in the notice of cancellation. If cancellation is due to nonpayment of the
            agreement price, material misrepresentation, or a substantial breech of duties under the service CONTRACT,
            such notice will not be required.
            A ten percent (10%) penalty per month shall be added to a refund that is not made within forty-five (45) days
            of the return of this CONTRACT to Us.
