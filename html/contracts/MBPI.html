            Purchaser ("PURCHASER") of the Vehicle ("VEHICLE"). This is not an insurance contract. This CONTRACT is not issued by
            the manufacturer or wholesale company marketing the product. This CONTRACT will not be honored by such manufacturer or
            wholesale company. The CONTRACT provides specific protection for the parts (which are not excluded) for the time or mileage as
            specified above, whichever occurs first. Subject to the terms and conditions of this CONTRACT, itemized herein, provisions for
            payment will be made to repair or replace, at reasonable COST for parts and labor, any parts (which are not excluded) in this
            CONTRACT as authorized by the ADMINISTRATOR, if required due to a MECHANICAL BREAKDOWN. The decision
            concerning procedure to repair or replace the parts shall be made at the discretion of the ADMINISTRATOR. <u>Replacement of
            parts may be with like kind and quality (i.e. new, remanufactured or pre-owned parts).</u> As a condition precedent to the
            obligations to provide for the payment of authorized repairs, the PURCHASER shall have complied with all terms and conditions of
            this CONTRACT.
            For All Plans, the time and mileage terms start on the contract date of sale and mileage on vehicle’s odometer at time of sale.
            Coverage expires when length of time is reached or vehicle’s odometer equals the sum of term mileage purchased plus mileage on
            your vehicle on the contract date of sale, whichever comes first.

            <h3>Cost</h3>
            Repair costs that are recognized locally and/or nationally for a similar repair. The ADMINISTRATOR may use published
            parts and labor guides to establish COSTS.

            <h3>Mechanical Breakdown</h3>
            a breakage or total failure of a covered part. MECHANICAL BREAKDOWN does not provide
            for damage resulting from the failure of an excluded part(s) or the lack of proper maintenance services. Minor loss of fluid or seepage is
            considered normal and is not considered a MECHANICAL BREAKDOWN.

            provided for under a Manufacturer’s Warranty or Special Policy Program, payment will be provided for the required manufacturer’s
            deductible, less the DEDUCTIBLE specified above.

            <br/>
            This CONTRACT is inclusive of the manufacturer’s warranty; it does not replace the manufacturer’s warranty, but provides
            certain additional benefits during the term of the manufacturer’s warranty. Losses covered by the manufacturer during the
            manufacturer’s warranty period are not covered under this CONTRACT.

        <h1>OTHER ITEMS OF IMPORTANCE</h1>

        <p>
            <h3>LIMIT OF LIABILITY</h3>
            The total of all benefits paid or payable under this CONTRACT shall not exceed the price the PURCHASER paid for the VEHICLE
            (excluding taxes, license and fees). In no event will the liability for each MECHANICAL BREAKDOWN under this CONTRACT
            exceed the actual cash value of the VEHICLE (based on the current NADA trade-in value) at the time immediately preceding the
            MECHANICAL BREAKDOWN. The PROVIDER’S liability for incidental and consequential damages including, but not limited to,
            loss of use of specified VEHICLE or resulting inconvenience, loss of time, storage charges, lodging, other travel cost, income,
            maintenance, or from the breach of any implied warranties arising by law, is expressly excluded. The PROVIDER may direct
            termination of this CONTRACT, if the operation of the VEHICLE fails to comply with the terms and conditions of this CONTRACT.

            <h3>TRANSFER PROCEDURE</h3>
            This CONTRACT provides transfer benefits for the original PURCHASER and the specified VEHICLE only. The
            CONTRACT is transferable one time, subject to a fifty dollar ($50.00) transfer fee, provided: A) transfer is being made from
            original PURCHASER to a subsequent private owner (it may not be transferred to a dealer or the customer of a dealer); B)
            acceptable documentation that the VEHICLE was maintained in accordance with the "Maintenance Requirements" of this
            CONTRACT. Contact the ADMINISTRATOR at 844-201-4389 for instructions to receive this benefit. Submission must be
            completed within thirty (30) days of sale of VEHICLE.


            <h3>CANCELLATION PROCEDURES</h3>
            To cancel: PURCHASER/LENDER (A) must contact the SELLER to complete and sign the written cancellation form; (B) provide an
            odometer statement or other documentation of cancellation miles; and (C) if repossessed, provide a letter from the LENDER
            containing repossession date and mileage. (D) SELLER will provide ADMINISTRATOR with the cancellation documents. (E)
            ADMINISTRATOR will calculate the refund. (F) SELLER will issue the check to the PURCHASER/LENDER. If the
            PURCHASER/LENDER is unable to contact the SELLER, contact the ADMINISTRATOR at 844-201-4389 for assistance.
            This CONTRACT provides cancellation benefits for the original PURCHASER/LENDER/PROVIDER only. The
            PURCHASER/LENDER/PROVIDER may cancel this CONTRACT at any time, including when a loss of the CONTRACT occurs or 
            ATTKP216 Page 5 of 5
            when you sell the VEHICLE without transfer of this CONTRACT. For Missouri contracts, written notice to the PURCHASER will
            be mailed within fifteen (15) days of cancellation. In the event a request from the PURCHASER/LENDER/PROVIDER is made
            within sixty (60) days of purchase and no claims have been filed, a flat cancellation will be allowed. If the
            PURCHASER/LENDER/PROVIDER requests a cancellation after sixty (60) days or has filed a claim, the ADMINISTRATOR agrees
            to calculate and make available a pro-rata refund percentage figure based on time or mileage, whichever refund is less (less any paid
            claims if the CONTRACT was not purchased at the time of the VEHICLE purchase). The PROVIDER and SELLER agree to return
            their respective portions of the pro-rata refund. The LENDER will be the sole payee when the collateral has been repossessed or is a
            total loss and the lien is still active. In most cases, the SELLER will issue the final refund check to the PURCHASER/LENDER. A
            ten percent (10%) penalty per month shall be added to a refund that is not paid or credited within thirty (30) days. All cancellations
            are subject to a fifty dollar ($50.00) cancellation fee, except flat cancels.

            <h3>OUR RIGHTS TO RECOVER FUNDS PAID ON YOUR BEHALF</h3>
            If you have a right to recover any funds that we have paid under this CONTRACT, you hereby assign those rights to us. Your rights
            become our rights and you agree to do whatever is reasonably necessary to enable us to enforce those rights. We shall be entitled to retain
            only funds that reimburse our actual costs and only after you are fully compensated for your loss.

            <h3>SUBROGATION CLAUSE</h3>
            The PURCHASER hereby assigns to the ADMINISTRATOR all rights to proceed against any supplier, rebuilder, or manufacturer for
            the cost of any defective covered part or any consequential damages or costs paid by the ADMINISTRATOR arising from the
            defective covered part.

            <h3>REFUND FOR NO CLAIMS</h3>
            If any representation has been made to you that you would receive a refund of the CONTRACT purchase price if you made no claims
            during the CONTRACT term, such representation was made without the consent of the ADMINISTRATOR or PROVIDER and is not
            binding on the ADMINISTRATOR or PROVIDER. The ADMINISTRATOR and PROVIDER do not offer a cost refund of the
            CONTRACT price after the CONTRACT term has expired if no claims are made.
