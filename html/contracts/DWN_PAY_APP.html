        <h1>CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT INFORMATION</h1>

        <p>
            By signing below, I authorize MBP Finance, to withdrawal my scheduled loan payment of ${{dwn}} from my
            credit card account. If I have chosen to use this account for my monthly payment then additional payments will be
            withdrawaln on or after the {{payments_day}} of each month. I further authorize MBP Finance to adjust this withdrawal
            to reflect any additional fees, charges or credits to my account authorized by this Note. I understand I have a
            right to receive notice of all varying debits but by signing below I agree that MBP Finance will only notify me 10
            days prior to any given transfer if the amount to be transferred varies by more than $75.00 from my regular
            scheduled payment amount.<br/>
            I agree that, in the event that any withdrawal authorized in accordance with this authorization is rejected, MBP
            Finance may attempt additional times to initiate it. I understand that my bank may impose fees in connection with
            rejected withdrawals, and I agree that MBP Finance does not have any liability for such fees.
            If I know that a withdrawal will be rejected by my bank (because there is not enough money in my account), I
            should contact MBP Finance so that alternate arrangements can be made. I understand that withdrawals are
            subject to applicable law and network rules.<br/>
            I understand that this authorization and the services undertaken by MBP Finance in no way alter or lessen my
            obligations under the loan agreement. I understand and acknowledge that this authorization is not a condition to
            obtaining this loan and that I may terminate this authorization at any time (including prior to my first payment due
            date) by contacting MBP Finance directly at the address listed on the first page of my agreement and within a
            timeframe as to afford MBP Finance and my bank a reasonable opportunity to act on my request. In any event,
            MBP Finance will comply with my termination request within three business days. Terminating this authorization
            does not affect my obligation to repay the amount due under my Agreement.<br/>
