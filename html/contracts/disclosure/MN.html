        <h1>SPECIAL MINNESOTA REQUIREMENTS AND DISCLOSURE</h1>
        <h2>
            The following State Specific Requirements apply if your CONTRACT was purchased in MINNESOTA and
            supersede any other provision herein of the contrary:
        </h2>

        <p>
            Section 325F.662 of the Minnesota Statutes requires the selling dealer to provide you with an express warranty
            of a specified duration in connection with the sale of any used car. The terms of the express warranty are
            contained in the used car buyer’s guide or limited warranty document furnished to you by the dealer. Any loss
            covered under the dealer’s express warranty furnished pursuant to Section 325F.662 is excluded from coverage
            under this CONTRACT during the term of the express warranty unless the dealer becomes unable to meet
            its obligations, provided such loss is otherwise covered by this CONTRACT. If you purchased a used
            VEHICLE, upon request and payment of $10.00, the administrator will provide a copy of the owner’s manual
            to you. There is no exclusion for pre-existing conditions, normal wear and tear or repairs caused to a covered
            part by a non-covered part or by "consequential" damage from a non-covered part. Exclusion of coverage
            for odometer tampering in any form applies only if it occurs and you fail to repair while the VEHICLE is owned
            by you. There is no exclusion for repairs or replacements of motor vehicle components which were not
            operating properly in accordance with Manufacturer’s specifications at the time of sale of this Service
            CONTRACT or if the VEHICLE is found to be rebuilt or refurbished from a total loss or to have a branded
            title.
            A ten percent (10%) penalty per month must be added to a refund that is not paid or credited within fortyfive
            (45) days after return of the CONTRACT to the PROVIDER.
