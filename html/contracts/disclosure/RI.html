        </h2>

        <p>
            Section 31-5.4 of Rhode Island General Business Law requires an automobile dealer to provide a warranty
            covering certain classes of used motor vehicles as follows: Used vehicles less than 36,000 miles or less at the
            time of sale - Provides coverage for 60 days or 3,000 miles, whichever occurs first. Used vehicles greater
            than 36,000 miles but less than 100,000 miles at the time of sale - Provides coverage for 30 days or 1,000
            miles, whichever occurs first. The VEHICLE you have purchased may be covered by this law. If so, the
            following is added to this CONTRACT: In addition to the dealer warranty required by this law, you have
            elected to purchase this CONTRACT, which may provide you with additional protection during the dealer
            warranty period and provides protection after the dealer warranty has expired. You have been charged
            separately only for this CONTRACT. The required dealer warranty is provided free of charge. Furthermore,
            the definitions, coverages and exclusions stated in this CONTRACT apply only to this CONTRACT and are
            not the terms of the required dealer warranty.
