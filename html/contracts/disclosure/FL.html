        <h1>SPECIAL FLORIDA REQUIREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES</h1>
        <h2>
            The following State Specific Requirements apply if your CONTRACT was purchased in FLORIDA and
            supersede any other provision herein of the contrary
        </h2>

        <p>
            Under the TRANSFER PROCEDURE section, the fifty dollar ($50.00) transfer fee is changed to reflect a forty
            dollar ($40.00) transfer fee.<br/>

            The section entitled "CANCELLATION PROCEDURES" is replaced in its entirety with the following: If this
            CONTRACT is canceled by PURCHASER/LENDER within 60 days after purchase, the refund will be
            100% of the gross premium paid, less any claims paid. An administrative fee may be charged which will
            not exceed 5% of the gross premium paid by the purchaser. After the CONTRACT has been in effect for
            60 days, it may not be canceled by the ADMINISTRATOR unless: 1) There has been a material
            misrepresentation or fraud at the time of sale of the CONTRACT; 2) PURCHASER/LENDER has failed
            to maintain the motor vehicle as prescribed by the manufacturer; 3) The odometer has been tampered with
            or disabled and PURCHASER/LENDER has failed to repair the odometer; 4) For nonpayment of
            premium by the PURCHASER/LENDER, in which case the PURCHASER shall be provided with a
            notice of cancellation by the ADMINISTRATOR via certified mail. If the CONTRACT is canceled by
            the ADMINISTRATOR, the return of premium will not be less than 100% of the paid unearned pro rata
            premium, less any claims paid. If, after 60 days, the CONTRACT is canceled by the
            PURCHASER/LENDER, then the PURCHASER/LENDER will be paid directly not less than 90% of the
            unearned pro rata premium by the ADMINISTRATOR, less any claims paid. The ADMINISTRATOR
            will remain responsible for full refunds to the PURCHASER/LENDER on canceled service agreements.
            However, the salesperson and agent are responsible for the refund of the unearned pro rata commission.
            The pro rata refund will be based on time or mileage, whichever refund is less. The SELLER is
            responsible for the refund of their unearned pro rata commission. In the event of a lien the LENDER will
            be named as co-payee on the refund check. The LENDER will be the sole payee when the collateral has
            been repossessed or is a total loss. In most cases, the SELLER will issue the final refund check to the
            PURCHASER/LENDER. TO CANCEL THIS CONTRACT, contact the ADMINISTRATOR at 1-877-
            238-3417 for assistance. You will be sent a cancellation form with instructions on how to complete it.

            specified above, whichever occurs first. Subject to the terms and conditions of this CONTRACT, itemized herein, provisions for
            payment will be made to repair or replace, at reasonable COST for parts and labor, any parts (which are not excluded) in this
            CONTRACT as authorized by the ADMINISTRATOR, if required due to a MECHANICAL BREAKDOWN. The decision
            concerning procedure to repair or replace the parts shall be made at the discretion of the ADMINISTRATOR. <u>Replacement of
            parts may be with like kind and quality (i.e. new, remanufactured or pre-owned parts).</u> As a condition precedent to the
            obligations to provide for the payment of authorized repairs, the PURCHASER shall have complied with all terms and conditions of

            For All Plans, the time and mileage terms start on the contract date of sale and mileage on vehicle’s odometer at time of sale.
            Coverage expires when length of time is reached or vehicle’s odometer equals the sum of term mileage purchased plus mileage on
            your vehicle on the contract date of sale, whichever comes first.
