					RECEIVE NOTICE OF ALL VARYING DEBITS BUT I AGREE THAT MBPI FINANCE WILL ONLY NOTIFY ME 10 DAYS PRIOR TO ANY GIVEN
					TRANSFER IF THE AMOUNT TO BE TRANSFERRED VARIES BY MORE THAN $75.00 FROM MY REGULAR
					SCHEDULED PAYMENT AMOUNT.</p>

					WITH THIS AUTHORIZATION IS REJECTED, MBP FINANCE MAY ATTEMPT ADDITIONAL TIMES TO INITIATE IT. I UNDERSTAND THAT MY
					BANK MAY IMPOSE FEES IN CONNECTION WITH REJECTED WITHDRAWALS, AND I AGREE THAT MBP FINANCE DOES NOT HAVE ANY
					LIABILITY FOR SUCH FEES. IF I KNOW THAT A WITHDRAWAL WILL BE REJECTED BY MY BANK (BECAUSE THERE IS NOT ENOUGH MONEY
					IN MY ACCOUNT), I SHOULD CONTACT MBP FINANCE SO THAT ALTERNATE ARRANGEMENTS CAN BE MADE. I UNDERSTAND THAT
					WITHDRAWALS ARE SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAW AND NETWORK RULES.</p>
